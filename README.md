### Solved chests

Nobody found the money yet..
Maybe you will be the first one?

## FAQ

### What is that?

A public domain collection of password-protected crypto wallets.

Are you smart enough to figure out the passwords? Then crack my wallets and get your prize!

### Is this legit / legal?

Participation is completely free, and it's a skill and investigation game, so there is no luck or randomness factor involved.

Everyone gets the same clues, so it's also a speed game (you need to studies the clues and find the answer before the others).

### How can I contact you or follow news?

### Where does the money come from?

Donations to the tip jar (see below) and my pocket money.
I only create chests with amounts I can afford to give away, which is why I only create a couple of chests every 6 months or so.

### What's the token about?

The official Crypto-chests.com token is now being used to hold values of our chests:

https://solscan.io/token/cheETCRRczF8kUqKuynFYGHenSJUtSC5ydBkbxcTpvX

If the price of the token increase, so will the value of the chests, creating an exciting incentive for the people smart enough to find the solutions.

In the future, the token might be used as a way to get access to exclusive chests or clues.

### Can you create more chests / give more clues?

Basically this depends on the donations received on the tip jar.

The more donations I receive, the more chests I can create, with bigger amounts.

But if interest is low, then I will only very slowly release clues, to keep the existing chests in the game.

So in short if you want more action, send a tip!

### That's fun. How can I tip?

Option 1: help the project as a whole

- Purchase some $CRYPTOCHESTS on Raydium: https://raydium.io/swap/?inputMint=cheETCRRczF8kUqKuynFYGHenSJUtSC5ydBkbxcTpvX&outputMint=sol
- Hold it for yourself! or donate some to the account used to create chests: https://solscan.io/account/buyMW6XJUGcVVjDjnG3LWTekfFb3GgKWZaH9xAY16DK

Option 2: tip me

Help me personally by sending some BTC to my tip jar: [bc1quwxl6wd4wpcnys747xv6y8fwr3qvas5u8z2tj9](https://www.blockonomics.co/#/search?q=bc1quwxl6wd4wpcnys747xv6y8fwr3qvas5u8z2tj9)

### I found one of the passwords

Congratulations - don't forget to collect your coins!

Can you please post the solution on X? You can mention [@CryptoChests](https://x.com/CryptoChests)

### One of the chests is empty

I don't have an automated system yet to detect this.

Can you please ping [@CryptoChests](https://x.com/CryptoChests)?

If someone opens one of the chest I will post the solution, and update this page to mark it as resolved.

### Can you guarantee you won't open the chest before us?

No, but this wouldn't really change anything to the game.
It's about trying to open the wallet before someone else does.

If a wallet gets emptied, I will post here and on X the solution,
that way you will be able to decide for yourself if the clues were legit enough to be guessable (they are but it's hard - it's a multi months/years game).

### Can they be brute forced? What do the passwords look like?

I can tell you that no password will be less than 12 characters.

They may contain uppercase or lowercase characters, commas, dashes, underscores, words in foreign languages, a period at the end etc.

Depending on the case, some clues will explain those characteristics.
