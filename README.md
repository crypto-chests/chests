# crypto-chests

## What is that?

A public domain collection of password-protected crypto wallets.

Are you smart enough to figure out the passwords? Then crack my wallets and get your prize!

## Wait.. is this legit?

Yes, it's a treasure hunt, you don't need to pay anything. It's not a commercial game or service.

The wallets are mine and free to download. They aren't valued very high since it's my pocket money but it's real.

So if you manage to find the passwords.. all yours.

## I found one of the passwords

Congratulations - don't forget to collect your coins!

Can you please post the solution on X? You can mention [@CryptoChests](https://x.com/CryptoChests)

## One of the chests is empty

I don't have an automated system yet to detect this.

Can you please ping [@CryptoChests](https://x.com/CryptoChests)?

If someones opens one of the chest I will post the solution, and update this page to mark it as resolved.

## Can I get a clue please?

Clues are going to be sparse, will be first posted on [@CryptoChests](https://x.com/CryptoChests), then on this page.

## Can you guarantee you won't open the chest before us?

No, but this wouldn't really change anything to the game.
It's about trying to open the wallet before someone else does.

If a wallet gets emptied, I will post here and on X the solution,
that way you will be able to decide for yourself if the clues where enough or not.

## That's fun. How can I tip?
